# n2

Project [nidus](https://github.com/hengyang-zhao/nidus.git) has many design
flaws proved by everyday terminal/shell interactions. It's time to design the
next generation config management framework --- n2. The new framework should
have the following improvements:

1. Have a more straightforward installation process.

2. Be able to be cleanly unstalled.

3. Be able to version-control site-specific configurations.

4. Provide theme-based shell appearance management.

5. Make the configurations of different programs (tmux/vim/git/...) pluggable.
